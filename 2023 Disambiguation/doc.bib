ABSTRACT = {Allegories are enriched categories generalizing a category of sets and binary relations. In this paper, we extend a new, recently-introduced conceptual data model based on allegories by adding support for modal operators and developing a modal interpretation of the model in any allegory satisfying certain additional (but natural) axioms. The possibility of using different allegories allows us to transparently use alternative logical frameworks, such as fuzzy relations. Mathematically, our work demonstrates how to enrich with modal operators and to give a many world semantics to an abstract algebraic logic framework. We also give some examples of applications of the modal extension.},

	title = {Relation Algebra as programming language using the Ampersand compiler},
	author = {Stef Joosten},
	abstract = {Relation Algebra can be used as a programming language for building information systems. This paper demonstrates the principle by presenting a case study together with the theory behind programming in Relation Algebra. As a case study, we have developed a database application for legal reasoning. We discuss a small part of it to illustrate the mechanisms of programming in Relation Algebra. Beside being declarative, relation algebra comes with attractive prospects for developing software. The compiler that was used for this case study, Ampersand, is the result of an open source project. Ampersand has been tried and tested in practice and is available as free open source software.1},
